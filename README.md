You can create a password generator in Python using the hashlib library to hash the sum of the master key and user information.Here's a simple example:
import hashlib

def generate_password(master_key, user_info):
    # Concatenate master key and user info
    combined_info = master_key + user_info
    
    # Hash the combined information using SHA-256
    hashed_info = hashlib.sha256(combined_info.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    # Return the first 12 characters of the hashed value as the password
    return hashed_info[:12]

def main():
    # Get master key and user information from the user
    master_key = input("Enter your master key: ")
    user_info = input("Enter your user information: ")
    
    # Generate and print the password
    password = generate_password(master_key, user_info)
    print("Generated password:", password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This code prompts the user to enter their master key and user information, then generates a password by hashing the sum of the master key and user information using the SHA-256 algorithm. The first 12 characters of the hashed value are returned as the password.
