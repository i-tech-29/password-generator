In large networks, it is very difficult to create and store passwords for each server or network device. Thanks to this password generator, it is possible to create a unique password for each network device's or server's IP address.
You can create a password generator in Python using the hashlib library to hash the sum of the master key and IP address.
This code prompts the user to enter their master key and IP address, then generates a password by hashing the sum of the master key and user information using the SHA-256 algorithm. The first 12 characters of the hashed value are returned as the password.
