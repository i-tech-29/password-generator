You can create a password generator in Python using the hashlib library to hash the sum of the master key and user information.
This code prompts the user to enter their master key and user information, then generates a password by hashing the sum of the master key and user information using the SHA-256 algorithm. The first 12 characters of the hashed value are returned as the password.
